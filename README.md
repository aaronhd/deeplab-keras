### What is this repository for? ###

* I am going to implement deeplab(v2) in Keras.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Implementing the models (both single-scale and multi-scale) layer by layer in Keras.
* Checking the consistency of the model parameters with the parameters in Tensorflow-deeplab-resnet repository framework.
* Grabbing the pre-trained weights of Tensorflow-deeplab-resnet and loading them onto your Keras model.
* Comparing the performance of the implemented model with the Tensorflow model on validation data.
